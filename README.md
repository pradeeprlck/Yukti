# Yukti (युक्ति) — Autonomous NSE Trading Agent

> *Sanskrit: strategy, skill, clever reasoning*

A production-ready, AI-powered trading agent for the Indian stock market (NSE/BSE).
Reasons like a human trader, executes with DhanHQ, learns from its own trades.

**Status:** Beta — Core paper/shadow loop is stable and ready for validation. Not yet recommended for unsupervised live trading.

---

## 🎯 Current Status

The end-to-end paper trading loop is **complete and stable**. All critical bugs have been fixed. The agent can be run in paper or shadow mode for multi-week validation before promoting to live.

### Feature Status

#### Core Agent
- **Multi-AI support** — ✅ Claude Sonnet 4.6, Gemini 2.0 Flash, A/B test mode
- **Order management** — ✅ Crash-safe state machine with GTTs, partial fill handling, startup reconciliation
- **Risk sizing** — ✅ Conviction-based position sizing with 8 hard gates (incl. NSE circuit-breaker)
- **Signal filtering** — ✅ 7 technical patterns pre-filter ~80% of candles to save API costs
- **Learning memory** — ✅ Voyage AI embeddings → pgvector similarity → past trades injected as context
- **Macro context** — ✅ India VIX, FII/DII net flows, live market headlines injected per cycle

#### Operations
- **Crash recovery** — ✅ Auto-detects and re-arms stuck positions on startup
- **Dead man's switch** — ✅ Watchdog auto-halts if signal loop goes silent
- **Observability** — ✅ Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured logging
- **Web portal** — ✅ React 18 SPA, real-time WebSocket, kill switch, journal browser
- **Telegram alerts** — ✅ Trade notifications, crash alerts, daily summary, `/halt` command

#### Scheduler & Control Plane

- The control plane (`ControlPlaneService`) now starts the application's cron-style scheduler. When the control plane is started it calls `build_scheduler()` (from `yukti/scheduler/jobs.py`) and starts it; on shutdown the service calls `scheduler.shutdown(wait=False)` to stop jobs cleanly.
- Key scheduler jobs are defined in `yukti/scheduler/jobs.py`: `job_morning_prep`, `job_eod_squareoff`, `job_daily_reset`, and `job_daily_report`. These perform tasks such as end-of-day square-off, daily counter resets, and journal writing.
- Files changed: `yukti/services/control_plane_service.py` (starts/shuts down scheduler), `yukti/scheduler/jobs.py` (job definitions). See those files for exact behavior and cron timings.
- Notes:
    - The scheduler is started automatically when the `ControlPlaneService` runs (used in live/shadow modes). In `paper` mode the agent runs a single scan and the control plane (and scheduler) is not started by default.
    - To disable scheduled jobs for testing/CI, run with `MODE=paper` or avoid starting the `ControlPlaneService`.
    - Ensure the database migration that creates the `positions` table (e.g., `yukti/data/migrations/versions/003_positions.py`) is applied before running the control plane.

#### Infrastructure
- **Database** — ✅ PostgreSQL 16 + TimescaleDB + pgvector, Redis 7
- **Async architecture** — ✅ 100% async-first with asyncio, graceful shutdown
- **Docker** — ✅ Single-command `docker compose up`
- **Testing** — ✅ Unit tests (risk, signals, AI schema); integration test for full trade cycle
- **Deployment** — ✅ Supervisor config, Grafana dashboards, Prometheus scraping

#### Modes
- **Paper trading** — ✅ Simulated fills, full agent logic
- **Shadow mode** — ✅ Live market data, orders logged but never placed (zero-risk parallel validation)
- **Live trading** — ✅ Real DhanHQ orders (validate with paper/shadow first)
- **Backtest** — ✅ Historical candle replay with PaperBroker

## 🎯 Why Yukti?

Most retail trading bots are:
- **Rule-based** — brittle, don't adapt, can't handle edge cases
- **Backtested to death** — overfitted, fail in live markets
- **A black box** — no way to debug why a trade was (or wasn't) taken

Yukti flips this:
- **Reasoning engine** — Claude or Gemini *thinks* about each setup, writes a conviction score, explains the trade
- **Risk first** — deterministic 8-gate risk filter after every AI decision
- **Learning loop** — journals every closed trade, embeds it in vector memory, injects lessons into future decisions
- **Crash-safe** — recovers from process crashes without losing state or exposing positions
- **Multi-provider** — switches between Claude (best reasoning) and Gemini (free tier) — even A/B tests both in parallel

---

## 📊 Architecture

```
Market (NSE/BSE)
    ↓ [DhanHQ WebSocket + REST]
Ingestion (OHLCV + perf state)
    ↓
Signals (indicators + patterns)
    ↓ [pre-filter: skip 80% of candles]
AI Brain (Claude or Gemini)
    ↓ [TradeDecision JSON]
Risk Gates (8 deterministic checks)
    ↓
Execution (DhanHQ orders → GTTs)
    ↓
Learning Loop (journal + vector embeddings)
    ↓ [stored in PostgreSQL]

## 🧠 The AI brain

**System prompt:** Arjun, an experienced NSE trader with disciplined rules:
- **Wait more than you act** — conviction scores 5-10, skip marginal setups
- **Risk first** — every trade has a hard stop loss at a swing level
- **Conviction-based sizing** — 9-10 → 1.5×, 7-8 → 1.0×, 5-6 → 0.5× position size
- **Learn from history** — past 3 similar setups injected as context

**Output:** Deterministic JSON schema validated before any order placed.

**Cost (with pattern pre-filter):**
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: **₹0/month** (free tier covers retail volume)
- Claude Sonnet 4.6: **₹5-15/month** (if used live)

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings in `.env`:

```env
# Broker
DHAN_CLIENT_ID=xxx
DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxx

# AI (choose one or both)
AI_PROVIDER=gemini                    # or: claude, ab_test
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx

# Performance
ACCOUNT_VALUE=500000                  # ₹
RISK_PCT=0.01                         # 1% per trade
MODE=paper                            # paper | live | shadow | backtest

# Candles
CANDLE_INTERVAL=5                     # minutes
WATCHLIST=RELIANCE,HDFCBANK,INFY,TCS

# Notifications
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=xxx
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=xxx
```

**Production:** Use Doppler instead of `.env`:
```bash
doppler run -- uv run python -m yukti
```

---

## 📊 Decision quality validation

After 2 weeks of paper trading:

```bash
uv run python -m yukti.agents.quality --days 14
```

Output shows:
- Skip rate (% of candles that became SKIP decisions)
- Win rate per conviction bucket (1-10)
- Setup type performance breakdown
- Signal: is conviction actually predictive? ("strong_predictive", "no_signal", or "inverted")

If conviction doesn't predict outcomes, the prompt needs work before live trading.

---

## 🔄 Learning loop

Every closed trade triggers:

1. **Journal writer** (Claude) writes 4-sentence reflection:
   - What the setup was
   - What happened
   - Why it worked or failed
   - One concrete lesson

2. **Voyage AI** embeds the journal (1024-dim vector)

3. **pgvector** stores it; on next similar setup, top-3 past entries injected into Claude's context

Result: The agent learns from its own history without retraining.

---

## 🛡️ Safety features

- **Kill switch** — `/halt` Telegram command stops all new trades immediately
- **Daily loss limit** — auto-halt at -2% of account
- **Max positions** — concurrent limit of 5
- **Conviction floor** — skip if conviction < 5
- **R:R minimum** — skip if risk:reward < 1.8
- **Cooldown** — symbol blacklisted for 3 cycles after a trade
- **Watchdog** — detects if signal loop stops (deadlock), auto-halts
- **NSE circuit breaker** — halts all new entries when Nifty drops ≥ 5% intraday
- **Crash recovery** — on restart, re-arms unprotected filled positions or exits them at market

---

## 📈 Expected performance

**Realistic targets (NSE mid-caps, 5-min intraday):**
- Win rate: 45-55% (quality matters more than frequency)
- Average R:R: 2.0-3.0
- Monthly expectancy: 0.5-1.5% (compound, reinvested)

**What breaks Yukti:**
- Gaps > 5% (no fill on SL)
- Sudden news events (before AI reacts)
- High-slippage illiquid scrips

**What it handles well:**
- Trending days (breakout/pullback setups)
- Volatile mid-caps (higher risk = higher reward)
- Multiple timeframe confluence (structured SL/target)

## 🚨 Disclaimer

Trading involves real financial risk. Check current SEBI regulations on algorithmic trading
before deploying live. Never deploy capital you cannot afford to lose.

This is a tool, not financial advice. Use it responsibly.

## 🔧 Signal Quality Upgrade — Progress (2026-04-24)

Current progress on the Signal Quality Upgrade (detailed plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-signal-quality-upgrade.md`):

- Completed:
    - Reconciled plan document and tracked tasks in workspace TODOs.
    - Implemented the Learning Loop service (`yukti/services/learning_loop_service.py`) with a `run_once()` batch embed runner and a simple manual entry point.
    - Added a unit test for the learning loop (`tests/unit/test_learning_loop.py`).
    - Added Alembic migration to prepare `pgvector` and an ANN index (`yukti/data/migrations/versions/004_journal_embeddings.py`).
    - Registered a scheduler job (`job_learning_loop`) in `yukti/scheduler/jobs.py` (config-gated).
    - Updated Arjun context and ORB/VWAP support in the signals/context and agents (prompt) layers.
    - Wired daily candle fetching into the market scan pipeline.

- Pending (remaining tasks):
    - Add retrieval tests that mock Voyage embeddings and validate `retrieve_similar()`.
    - Add MarketScan integration tests that exercise scanning → decision → open_trade flow under fakes.
    - Add universe scanner unit tests and additional pattern tests.
    - Add CI workflow to run unit tests and optional integration jobs.
    - Commit & open a PR for review, run full test suite locally or in CI, and produce the final report.

Notes and quick commands
------------------------
- Run the learning loop manually (one-shot):

```bash
# Manual runner (uses the LearningLoopService if run as a module)
uv run python -m yukti.services.learning_loop_service
```

- Apply DB migrations (includes `004_journal_embeddings`):

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

- To enable the scheduled learning-loop job, set the configuration flag `enable_learning_loop` to true in your runtime settings or enable the job in the control plane (see `yukti/scheduler/jobs.py`).

If you want, I can: run the test suite locally (I will not execute it without your confirmation), add the CI workflow next, or open a PR with the current changes. Tell me which you'd like.
